# What is the multi-robot branch for?
This branch contains the **first multi-robot** implementation.


This code is before it was refractored to:
1) make it more readable and maintainable 
2) separate the belief and ground truth map classes

The next implmentation of this can be found in the branch `multi-robot_optimized`.

Run `test.py` with the following commands:
```bash
python3 test.py
```
